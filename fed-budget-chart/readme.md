# Federal Budget by Agency and Function

This chart reads collected U.S. budget data, allows the user to select one of 4 datasets to view (Discretionary Budget Authority by Function or Agency, Discretionary and Mandatory Budget Authority by Function or Agency) and displays them as a line chart. The user may then select and deselect checkboxes to compare lines within each dataset.

It was built with HighchartsJS, with additional vanilla JavaScript and CSS.
